Write a program that uses rotations and consumes spots.csv 
Generates output that shows cost per view (CPV) by the following dimension:

* CPV by rotation by day
For the purpose of this exercise, hereâ€™s some terminology:

* "Rotation" - The timerange on a TV network that an advertisement airs
---
When rotation times overlap, a spot should count in every valid rotation window, not just one.  Please modify the code to allow this.
---
#file:spots.csv When rotation times overlap, a spot should count in every valid rotation window, not just one.  Please modify the code to allow this.
---
In #file:test_spots_copilot.py , add tests for get_rotations
---
Please add tests for get_rotations for when the data is empty or not of type time, or anything else that may cause it to fail.   
---
#file:spots.py See the error below.  Fix get_rotations to not fail in this situation, and update test_non_time_type and any other tests as necessary to match the new expeted behaviour.
